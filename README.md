The Unpredictable Revenge Car 🚗💥

The Story 📖

It started as a simple idea—an RC car, controlled by a joystick, moving smoothly wherever its driver commanded. But then, we realized something... people were reckless. Crashes happened, accidents were inevitable, and the poor little car suffered every time.

Enough was enough.

This car wasn't just going to take the hits anymore. It was time for payback.

Now, every time the car crashes into an obstacle, it decides to mess with you. The controls scramble unpredictably—left becomes right, forward becomes backward. Suddenly, your once-loyal vehicle turns into an unpredictable beast, challenging you to adapt. Think you're in control? Think again.

About the Project 🎮

This project is an Arduino-powered joystick-controlled car with a mind of its own. Using an ultrasonic sensor, it detects obstacles and, upon impact, randomizes the joystick controls, forcing the user to rethink their movements. But beware—after the next crash, it resets, lulling you into a false sense of security before striking again!

Features 🛠️

Joystick-Controlled Movement – Move the car using an analog joystick.

Obstacle Detection – Uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect objects in its path.

Control Randomization – On impact, the control scheme shuffles once, disorienting the driver.

Reset Mechanism – Another crash restores the controls back to normal, keeping the game unpredictable.

Arduino-Powered – Built with Arduino, making it a fun and customizable project.

How It Works ⚙️

Use the joystick to control the car normally.

If the car crashes into an obstacle, it shuffles the movement directions.

The driver must adapt to the new controls.

Another crash resets the controls back to normal.

The cycle continues, keeping every drive an exciting challenge!

Components Used 🧩

Arduino Board (Uno, Mega, or similar)

L298N Motor Driver

DC Motors

Joystick Module

Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)

TFT Display (optional, for debugging or visual feedback)

Power Source (Battery Pack)

Setup & Instructions 🚀

Wire the components according to the provided circuit diagram.

Upload the Arduino sketch to your board.

Power up the car.

Start driving and try not to crash… or do, if you like chaos. 😈

Future Improvements 🔧

Adding a TFT display to show the current control scheme.

Implementing sound effects for each crash.

Creating different difficulty modes (e.g., more frequent control shuffling).

Conclusion 🎯

This project is not just a car—it's a lesson in unpredictability. Whether you're playing for fun, testing your reflexes, or just looking for a way to prank your friends, the Unpredictable Revenge Car guarantees an experience like no other. Drive carefully… or don't. Either way, the car has its own plans. 😉
